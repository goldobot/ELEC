Note en cours de rédaction à propos de ta question Goldo :
-Page 27 de la fiche technique du F303 :

TIM2, 3, and TIM4
These are full-featured general-purpose timers:
– TIM2 has a 32-bit auto-reload up/downcounter and 32-bit prescaler
– TIM3 and 4 have 16-bit auto-reload up/downcounters and 16-bit prescalers.
These timers all feature 4 independent channels for input capture/output compare,
PWM or one-pulse mode output. They can work together, or with the other generalpurpose
timers via the Timer Link feature for synchronization or event chaining.
The counters can be frozen in debug mode.
All have independent DMA request generation and support quadrature encoders.
